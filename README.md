# Swift-C

In this simple repo, you will find examples of calling C functions from Swift, and vice versa.

there is two directories, [`CFromSwift`](/CFromSwift) (calling C functions from Swift), and [`SwiftFromC`](/SwiftFromC) (calling Swift functions from C).

each directory has a `run.sh` script to compile and link both files and execute the resulting binary.

## prerequisites 
- Swift compiler
- C compiler (GCC)
